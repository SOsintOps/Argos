# ARGOS — Beta
<img align="right" width="86" height="150" src="https://github.com/SOsintOps/Argos/blob/master/multimedia/images/scribblenauts-argos.png">

> **WARNING: BETA VERSION**
> This script has been updated for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 LTS.
> It is under active testing. Always run it on a clean VM before using it in production.
> Report any problems by opening an issue.

Argos automatically configures an open-source OSINT workstation from a clean Ubuntu 24.04 LTS virtual machine.

Best practice recommends using a dedicated VM for each OSINT investigation.
This script follows the methods described by Michael Bazzell in [Open Source Intelligence Techniques](https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html).

## Requirements

- Ubuntu **24.04 LTS** or **Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 LTS** (VM or workstation)
- Any Linux username (the previous requirement to use `osint` has been removed)
- System language: **English**
- Active internet connection during installation
- **VirtualBox Guest Additions already installed** — the script does not install them. Install Guest Additions before running `setup.sh` to enable clipboard sharing, drag-and-drop, and fullscreen support.

> The script is optimised for VirtualBox. Code for VMware Tools is available in the comments.

**Tested on:**
- Ubuntu Budgie 24.04 LTS (VM)
- Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (VM)

**No longer supported:**
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (some dependencies are incompatible)
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Installation

1. Open a terminal.

2. Install Git if it is not already present:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git
    ```

3. Clone the repository into the `Downloads` directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SOsintOps/Argos ~/Downloads/Argos
    ```

4. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x ~/Downloads/Argos/setup.sh
    ```

5. Run the script:
    ```bash
    ~/Downloads/Argos/setup.sh
    ```

    > Firefox does not need to be closed or opened manually. The script initialises the Firefox profile automatically if it has not been created yet.

---

## Installation Log

The script automatically generates a log file in the Downloads directory:

```
~/Downloads/argos_install_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log
```

The log contains the full installation output with timestamps. If an error occurs, the exact line number is recorded in the log.
